# Book-Store-GUI
This program contains both front-end and back-end code for a bookstore app with a simple graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter library. While I personally might not choose Tkinter if I were to build a real-world app with modern UI, Tkinter serves me well in terms of getting me familiar with how to connect to databases(SQLite in this case), manipulatie data, and reflect the changes on the front end with Python.

For the standalone executable, please see the app folder and look for file named frontend inside folder dist.
